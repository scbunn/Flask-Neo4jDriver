"""Neo4j Drive Flask Extension.


This module defines the `neo4j`_ `flask`_ extension that integrates the
official `python driver`_ with Flask.

This extension exposes the neo4j :class:`neo4j.v1.GraphDatabase` and other
utility functions to assist with the interaction of the graph database through
the python driver.

        The driver maintains a pool of connections which are consumed by
        :class:`neo4j.v1.GraphDatabase.Session` instances.

        The type of driver is determined by the URI schemed passed at the time

            * bolt: `bolt://`
            * bolt+routing: `bolt+routing://`

        A driver is constructed based on the application configuration values
        that are present at the time of construction.  The following values
        are supported.

        Configuration values:
            GRAPHDB['uri'] (str): The URI for the graph database service.
            GRAPHDB['user'] (str): The user to connect as.
            GRAPHDB['pass'] (str): The password for the connected user.
            GRAPHDB['encrypted']: Boolean flag to determine if connection
                should be encrypted.
            GRAPHDB['trust'] (:obj:`int`): The trust level of certificates.
            GRAPHDB['max_con_lifetime'] (:obj:`int`): The maximum
                connection lifetime.
            GRAPHDB['max_con_pool_size'] (:obj:`int`): The max
                size of the connection pool.
