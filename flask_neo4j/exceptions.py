"""Flask Neo4jDriver Exceptions.

This module defines the exceptions used by the Neo4jDriver Flask extension.

Several of the neo4j-driver exceptions are subclassed here.  This is to assist
the caller in dealing with exceptions without having to have intimate knowledge
of the neo4j-driver.

If the caller is using the neo4j driver directly, then the caller will be
responsible for dealing with neo4j-driver exceptions directly.
